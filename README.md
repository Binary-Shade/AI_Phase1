## Demo

For a live demo of the Diabetes Prediction Web Application, visit [here](https://example.com/diabetes-prediction).

## Features

- Predicts diabetes risk based on user-input health data.
- Provides user-friendly interface for input.
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd diabetes-predictive-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the web application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

3. Input the required health data, and click the "Predict" button to get the diabetes risk prediction.

## Dataset

The machine learning model is trained on the [Diabetes Dataset]( (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). You can find more information about the dataset and its attributes in the [dataset folder](/dataset).
